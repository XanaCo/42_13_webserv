## Overview

The `Webserv` project is a comprehensive endeavor that involves creating a web server capable of handling HTTP requests. In this project, students are tasked with building a minimal HTTP server from scratch, capable of serving static and dynamic content, handling various HTTP methods, and managing client connections.

The `Webserv` project is an essential step in understanding web server architecture, networking protocols, and web development concepts. It requires implementing core features such as handling HTTP requests, parsing configuration files, managing server sockets, and processing client responses.

## Key Components

1. **HTTP Protocol Handling**: Implementing parsing and handling of HTTP requests and responses according to the HTTP protocol standards.

2. **Server Configuration**: Parsing and interpreting configuration files to define server settings such as port number, server name, and document root.

3. **Static Content Serving**: Serving static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to clients upon request.

4. **Dynamic Content Generation**: Implementing support for dynamic content generation using server-side languages (CGI and scripts).

5. **HTTP Methods Handling**: Supporting various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, DELETE, and handling them appropriately.

6. **Client Connections Management**: Managing client connections efficiently, handling multiple concurrent requests, and ensuring scalability.

7. **Error Handling**: Properly handling HTTP error codes and providing meaningful error messages to clients.

8. **Security Measures**: Implementing basic security measures such as input validation, preventing directory traversal attacks, and handling unauthorized access.

9. **Cookies**: Logging server activities and client requests for debugging and monitoring purposes.

10. **Concurrency**: Implementing concurrency mechanisms to handle multiple client connections concurrently, improving server performance.

## Key Skills Developed

1. **Networking**: Understanding networking protocols such as HTTP, TCP/IP, and socket programming to build a functional web server.

2. **Server-Side Programming**: Learning server-side scripting languages and techniques for generating dynamic content.

3. **Configuration Management**: Understanding configuration files and how to parse and interpret them to customize server behavior.

4. **Error Handling**: Developing robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected situations and errors.

5. **Security Principles**: Learning basic security principles and applying them to prevent common web security vulnerabilities.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Optimizing server performance through efficient resource management, caching, and concurrency.

7. **Debugging and Testing**: Debugging server issues and testing server functionality using tools and techniques for quality assurance.

8. **Project Management**: Working on a large-scale project with multiple components, managing dependencies, and collaborating with team members effectively.

9. **Documentation**: Documenting code and project functionalities for better understanding and future maintenance.
